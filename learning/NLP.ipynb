      "He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment , speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus \" at a proper level .\" But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time . \n",

      "4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4 . \n",
      "3 billion dlrs in 1985 . \n",
      "Kim , who is also economic planning minister , said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy , but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years . \n",
      "\" Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth , five billion dlrs of ( current account ) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year . \n",
      "But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected ,\" he said . \n",
      "Trade ministry officials said South Korea ' s exports rose 35 pct to 9 . \n",
      "34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year , while imports rose only 8 . \n",
      "5 pct to 8 . \n",
      "2 billion dlrs . \n",
      "Kim said the swing of South Korea ' s current account to a surplus of 4 . \n",
      "65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant . \n",

      "5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46 . \n",
      "8 billion in 1985 , is still among the largest in Asia . \n",
      "\" This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development ... Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy ,\" Kim said . \n",
      "Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country ' s GNP to about 20 pct in 1991 , from about 50 pct in 1986 . \n",
      "\" The government , however , does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus ,\" he said . \n",
      "Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with Seoul ' s major trading partners , particularly the United States . \n",

      "COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices , sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance ( CPA ) said . \n",
      "The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11 - member CPA which began on Monday . \n",
      "They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices . \n",
      "Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon . \n",
      "Prices , under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses , recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules . \n",
      "The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre - set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise . \n",
      "\" The world ' s cocoa price at present is just not interesting ,\" commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer . \n",
      "Another source said that with much of the 1986 / 87 ( October - September ) world cocoa crop sold , limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year ' s harvest . \n",
      "The sources noted , however , that the cocoa industry in Brazil , the world ' s number two producer , is in private hands . \n",
      "This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers , where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards . \n",
      "The CPA includes the world ' s top three producers , Ivory Coast , Brazil and Ghana , and accounts for 80 pct of all output . \n",
      "The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening . \n",

      "The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut , to 150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously , he said . \n",
      "The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations over a period of weeks , he said , adding the market ' s basic stability had warranted a cut in deposit rates . \n",

      "Spain ' s trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non - oil imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159 mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986 . \n",

      "COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE , BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price - support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices , many ICCO delegates and trade sources said . \n",
      "The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35 - member ICCO council after two weeks of talks . \n",
      "European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately , but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long . \n",

      "And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying , or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so , the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically , dealers said . \n",
      "The buffer stock is the market - regulating tool of the ICCO , into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre - set stabilization range . \n",
      "A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time . \n",
      "The new rules take effect immediately . \n",
      "The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks , after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market , since prices are below the \" must - buy \" level of 1 , 600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement , the sources said . \n",
      "The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100 , 000 tonnes within a five week period , but its approach will be more cautious , buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said . \n",
      "The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250 , 000 tonnes of cocoa , 100 , 000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock . \n",

      "Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in - store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin . \n",
      "But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member , while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day , which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material . \n",
      "Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non - member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material , traders said . \n",
      "Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures , but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures . \n",
      "Ghana ' s premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying , dealers said . \n",

      "Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets , but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable . \n",
      "\" Domestic costs have increased ( due to inflation ) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates ,\" Roldan said . \n",
      "The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil , where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs . \n",
      "But he added : \" They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels .\" Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee , and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world ' s largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance . \n",
      "Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) members to re - establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence . \n",
      "\" Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations , which others wanted changed ,\" one senior coffee dealer said . \n",
      "The dealer , who declined to be named , said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share . \n",
      "At the end of the talks , he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer . \n",
      "Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales , the dealer said . \n",
      "\" If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar , ninety or eighty cents ,\" he said . \n",
      "New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2 . \n",
      "29 cents lower Thursday at 104 . \n",
      "68 cents a lb , while more distant deliveries fell the six - cent maximum trading limit . \n",
      "President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute , Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas . \n",
      "Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped - up Brazilian marketing efforts . \n",
      "\" They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been ,\" according to Richard Loewy , analyst for Prudential - Bache Securities Inc . \n",
      "Loewy believes the foreign debt problem , a good crop , plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop . \n",
      "\" Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can ' t afford to store the crops ,\" he said . \n",
      "The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields . \n",
      "\" We are going to see a very rapid decline , earlier than usual , this year in our ( U . \n",
      "S .) exports ,\" Loewy said . \n",
      "Tommy Eshleman , economist for the American Soybean Association ( ASA ), said this year ' s Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes , versus 13 . \n",
      "7 mln last year . \n",
      "Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U . \n",

      "Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U . \n",

      "government soybean loan rate , offered to farmers who give crops as collateral , Eshleman said . \n",
      "He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate , which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market . \n",
      "Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan . \n",
      "\" We ' re getting into a period when they ( Brazil ) are starting to harvest and starting to export ,\" Eshleman said . \n",
      "But he added it will be a while before U . \n",
      "S . \n",
      "exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently . \n",
      "Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation . \n",
      "He said the debt situation was a major consideration . \n",
      "\" The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage ,\" he added . \n",
      "Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops , Melicias said it would not make a big difference . \n",
      "On other commodity markets , Brazil ' s selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital . \n",
      "Brazil is faced with a poor 1986 / 87 sugar harvest , which could limit exports to the world market , analysts said . \n",
      "The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments , and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar , will give it little room to stretch exports , they said . \n",
      "Brazil ' s other major crop , cocoa , is in its third year of surplus . \n",
      "\" Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell , so I don ' t think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it ,\" one analyst said . \n",
      "\" If they come out as aggressive sellers , the market would collapse and they can ' t afford to do that ,\" she added . \n",

      "COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market , government delegates and trade experts said . \n",
      "Only two weeks ago , world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated . \n",
      "This week , many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work . \n",
      "The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council ( ITC ), which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling , is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations . \n",
      "The ITC ' s failure has restricted negotiators ' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built - in flaws or unlimited liability , but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade . \n",
      "A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend . \n",
      "Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought . \n",
      "One consumer country delegate said this would \" distort , not support \" the market . \n",
      "Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder . \n",
      "On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows . \n",
      "The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices . \n",
      "The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the \" must buy \" level of 1 , 600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact , which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock . \n",
      "Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given . \n",
      "The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets . \n",
      "A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100 , 000 tonnes of cocoa , enough to mount large buying or selling operations , were carried forward from the previous agreement . \n",
      "Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade . \n",
      "It has an upper limit of 250 , 000 tonnes . \n",
      "The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non - member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa . \n",
      "Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters , and the full council meets on Thursday . \n",
      "Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non - member countries such as Malaysia . \n",
      "Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium - priced high quality cocoas . \n",
      "The argument over buying non - member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities . \n",
      "European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non - member cocoa and that it use the London futures market ' s existing differentials for different qualities . \n",
      "Currently , good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market . \n",
      "Discounts , which are currently under review , range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa . \n",

      "The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community , a key ICCO consumer group , with France siding with producers . \n",
      "EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and , a diplomatic source said , narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations . \n",
      "The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there . \n",
      "One ICCO delegate describing the producer / consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is \" meant to support the market where trade buying is not .\" In contrast , he said , producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers . \n",
      "Other , more technical , issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced \" posted price \" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers . \n",
      "In either case , delegates said , it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers . \n",

      "\" A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term ,\" he said , although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation . \n",
      "The Budget will inspire a lot of short - term confidence but it was \" not a good budget for inflation ,\" he said Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build - up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation . \n",
      "Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the \" leading edge \" of monetary policy , but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front . \n",
      "He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness . \n",

      "But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it . \n",
      "James Capel ' s Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent , Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no \" chickens coming home to roost .\" Richard Jeffrey , who favours the likelihood of a June election , said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory . \n",
